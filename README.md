Linear Regression:
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). In linear regression, the relationships are modelled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models.
